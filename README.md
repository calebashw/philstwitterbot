# philstwitterbot
## Author: Caleb Ash
## Created in June 2023
I developed This Twitter Bot to post Philadelphia Phillies-related tweets whenever I run the programs. It makes use of the Twitter API and MLB-StatsAPI. It is written entirely in Python. 

The access and API keys for the Twitter account are not included.

### Notice
* This repository is meant to display my work, and if anyone wants to see how I did it, they can learn to make their own bot. Please do not copy the content directly or make a copycat bot. Feel free to use it to make a similar bot for a different team.
* Check out the account and support, `@philstweetbot` on Twitter.
